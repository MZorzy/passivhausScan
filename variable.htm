<h3>
  Single variable optimization
</h3>

<p> This page is where you specify a variable to optimize, holding all
other variables fixed at their default values.  The optimization
objectives will be four energy metrics: <b>Heating
demand</b>, <b>Heating load</b>, <b>Cooling demand</b>,
and <b>Primary energy</b>.<br>
<br>
On the right, after a moment, the default variables are listed.  These
are the variables that have been identified as the 'source cells'
that affect the energy metrics. The default values listed for each of the default variables
are simply the values loaded from the PHPP workbook you have loaded.<br>
<br>
A particular variable may be chosen, and its range is specified using the entry tools in the
left sidebar.<br>
<br>
After the variable is and its range are configured, a button will
appear to launch the optimization, and four graphs will subsequently appear, showing variation of
the energy metrics, as your specified variable is varied over the
specified values.<br>
<br>
Please note that to observe variation in <b>Cooling demand</b>, mechanical
cooling must be activated in the cell Verification!K24.
