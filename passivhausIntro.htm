Passivhaus interface to PDT
</h2>
<br>
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>

<p> 
These pages provide your interface between Passivhaus, the building<br>
simulator, and ProtoLife's Predictive Design Technology (PDT).  This <br>
interface allows you to explore an almost limitless set of possibilities<br>
resulting in optimal values in your design---energy efficiency or costs.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p> 
The steps are:
</p>
<br>
<p>  
1.  Load your passivhaus file (to the left).
</p>
<br>
<p> 
 2.  Define your variables for PDT to explore (second tab on the top,
 labeled 'Specify Variables'), one variable
 at a time.
</p>
<br>
<p> 
 3.  Confirm variables, removing or adding variables, as necessary.
</p>

<br>
<p> 
 4.  Launch PDT to find the sweet spot in the space of variables you
have defined (third tab on the top, labeled 'Launch PDT').
